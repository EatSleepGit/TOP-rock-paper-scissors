## General info
# TOP-rock-paper-scissors
> Rock Paper Scissors game that is played against the computer. 
First TOP JS Project - Rock Paper Scissors for learning purposes.

This is the first, early version of the project.
I've got tons of more ideas to bring it way over the top but for now
it's somewhat simple and most creative choices, like colors and images 
are mere just placeholders to let focus on the coding. Which is quite a disaster,
I know.
